# Hring

## Description
Even though haptics play an important role in our perception of the outside world, it is still not that prevelant in VR and AR outside of vibrotactile cues. <br>
//Stuff still to add//
The HRing offers an affordable and easy to assemble alternative.
Through cutaneous stimuli by skin deformation the HRing gives the illusion of a bumpy surface.

## Hardware Setup
The HRing is made up of following parts:
- a Microcontroller (here: Raspberry Pico)
- two servo motors (here: Servo-S0403)
- a 3D printed skeleton (add link to model)
- velco strap 
- wires
